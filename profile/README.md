# Welcome to Safari Fruits üççü¶Å

Hey there fellow wanderer in the vast jungle of code! Welcome to Safari Fruits, where we believe in exploring the wild world of open-source while munching on some juicy fruits (metaphorically, of course). Grab your binoculars, put on your explorer hat, and let's embark on an adventure together!

## Who Are We?

We're just a bunch of tech enthusiasts who decided to trade in our office chairs for safari jeeps and our coffee mugs for coconut water. Our team is as diverse as the Amazon rainforest itself, with developers, designers, and dreamers all coming together to create something wild and wonderful.

## Our Mission üåü

At Safari Fruits, we're on a mission to make coding more fun than a barrel of monkeys. From zany live streams to quirky open-source projects, we're here to inject some humor and creativity into the tech world. Who said coding had to be serious all the time? Let's embrace the chaos and have a roaring good time!

## What We Do üöÄ

- **Live Streams:** Join us on our virtual safaris as we tackle coding challenges, brainstorm new project ideas, and maybe even encounter a bug or two along the way. Expect plenty of laughter, occasional facepalms, and maybe even a surprise guest appearance by a tech-savvy giraffe (okay, maybe not, but we can dream).

- **Open Source Projects:** From building apps that help you find the perfect pineapple pizza to creating websites dedicated to celebrating the majesty of sloths, our projects are as eclectic as our team. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a coding newbie, there's a place for you in our jungle.

## Get Involved! üå¥
